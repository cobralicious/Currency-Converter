# Currency Converter 💱

This Java-based Currency Converter 💰 application allows users to convert an amount from one currency to another using real-time exchange rates fetched from the ExchangeRate API 🌐. The program prompts the user to input a base currency, a target currency, and the amount they want to convert. It then retrieves the latest conversion rates 🔄 and calculates the equivalent amount in the target currency.

The application is built using Java ☕ and makes HTTP requests to the API to fetch the exchange rates. It handles errors 🚨, such as network issues or unavailable currencies, and provides clear feedback to the user. The project is a great example of working with APIs, handling JSON data 📊, and building interactive console applications in Java.

Key Features:
Real-time exchange rates pulled from the API 📈.

User input for selecting base and target currencies, and entering the amount to convert 🧑‍💻.

Error handling for issues like unsupported currencies or network failures ❌.

Easy-to-use interface, ideal for anyone who needs a simple currency converter 🔧.

This project demonstrates skills in API integration 🤖, JSON parsing 🧩, and user input handling in Java 🖥️, making it a perfect example for anyone learning how to work with external APIs and build interactive applications.
